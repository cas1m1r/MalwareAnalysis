# Malware Analysis 
Repository where I share some work trying to understand malware. 

I hold no security certifications, and this work is not the product of or for any security company. I am purely a researcher interested in understanding these things. It's difficult or impossible to have a public facing website *not* be hit with these kinds of botnet related traffic. 

Perhaps with enough analysis we can find a weakness or flaw that could change this. Either way, this kind of code poses an interesting puzzle.
